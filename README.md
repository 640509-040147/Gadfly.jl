# Gadfly

Gadfly is an implementation of a [Wickham](http://ggplot2.org/)-[Wilkinson](http://www.cs.uic.edu/~wilkinson/TheGrammarOfGraphics/GOG.html) style grammar of graphics in
Julia.

Parts of it are functional, but is very much incomplete and a work in progress.
Some basic plots can be drawn, but more importantly, it provides a basis for a
powerful, extensible, and efficient visualization system.

Check out the [overview](http://dcjones.github.com/Gadfly.jl/doc/) for the
current state.
