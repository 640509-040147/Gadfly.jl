# Gadfly

Gadfly is an implementation of a Wickham-Wilkinson style grammar of graphics in
Julia.

Parts of it are functional, but is very much incomplete and a work in progress.
Some basic plots can be drawn, but more importantly, it provides a basis for a
powerful, extensible, and efficient visualization system.

Stay tuned. More to come.
